Overview:----------
The Next Word Predictor project is an AI-based tool designed to predict the next word in a sentence. This project leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to achieve high accuracy in word prediction. The model is trained on a large corpus of text data to understand language patterns and predict the most likely next word based on the given input sequence.


Features:--------
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Utilizes RNNs for sequential data processing.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Employs LSTM cells to handle long-term dependencies and improve prediction accuracy.
Text Preprocessing: Includes data cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
Model Training: Customizable training parameters to fine-tune the model.
Prediction: Provides an interface to input text and receive the predicted next word.


Prerequisites:--------
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Pandas
